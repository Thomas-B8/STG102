README 

The point of this project is the replication of  Korpela et al. Proceedings B 2014 

8 codes are available 

1 ) code_donnees is used to data cleaning 
2 ) code_modeles is used for analysis 
3 ) code_simulations is used for the last part : simulations 

4) code_figures_density_all_species present average density by region for the 4 species 
5 ) code_figures_figure2 replicate the variance/proportion explained for Vole's models 
6 ) code_figures_figure3 replicate the variance/proportion explained for predator's models
7 ) code_figures_figure4 replicate the density dependance, s index and seasonlity graph for simulations 
8 ) code_figures_vole_density_simulation present the vole density by region predicted for all 24 simulations
