The point of this project is the replication of  *Korpela et al. Proceedings B 2014* 

8 codes are available 

- *code donnees* : in this code we open the original data and we clean them, we also add new variables like longitude and latitude information.

- *code modeles* : this code try to replicate the 15 models in the study : 5 populations (vole in spring, vole in autumn, small mustelids, generalist predators and avian predators) mutiplied by three regions (north, east and south-west). Also, we make hier calcylations for variance and proportion of variance explained.

- *code simulations* : is used to make the 24 simulations : 8 scenarios ( all predators, without small mustelids, only small mustelids, without generalist predators, only generalist predators, without avian predators, only avian predators, without predators) multiplied by three regions (north, east and south_west) . For each scenario : vole density, direct and delayed density dependance, s-index and seasonality are registered. 

- *code figures density all species* :  make graphic with mean density for each species and each region.

- *code figures figure2* :  try the replication of figure 2 in the article, proportion of variance explained for vole in spring and autumn.

- *code figures figure3* :   try the replication of figure 3 in the article, proportion of variance explained for the three types of predators .

- *code figures figure4* :  try the replication of figure 4 in the article, with indicator's results from the simulations : direct and delayed density dependance, s-index and seasonality.

- *code figures vole density simulation* :  present the vole density by region predicted for all 24 simulations for the 50 first years (100 points).
