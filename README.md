The point of this project is the replication of  Korpela et al. Proceedings B 2014 

8 codes are available 

1. 01_ code_donnees : in this code we open the original data and we clean them, we also add new variables like longitude and latitude information.
2. 02_ code_modeles : this code try to replicate the 15 models in the study : 5 populations (vole in spring, vole in autumn, small mustelids, generalist predators and avian predators ) mutiplied by three regions (north,east and south-west). Also, we make hier calcylations for variance and proportion of variance explained.
3. 03_ code_simulations : is used to make the 24 simulations : 8 scenarios ( all predators, without small mustelids, only small mustelids, without generalist predators, only generalist predators, without avian predators, only avian predators, without predators) multiplied by three regions (north,east and south_west) . For each scenario : vole density, direct and delayed density dependance, s-index and seasonality are registered. 
4. 04_ code_figures_density_all_species :  make graphic with mean density for each species and each region.
5. 05_code_figures_figure2 :  try the replication of figure 2 in the article, proportion of variance explained for vole in spring and autumn.
6. 06_code_figures_figure3 :   try the replication of figure 3 in the article, proportion of variance explained for the three types of predators .
7. 07_code_figures_figure4 :  try the replication of figure 4 in the article, with indicator's results from the simulations : direct and delayed density dependance, s-index and seasonality.
8. 08_ code_figures_vole_density_simulation :  present the vole density by region predicted for all 24 simulations for the 50 first years (100 points).
